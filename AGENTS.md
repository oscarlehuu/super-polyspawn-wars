## Specification
The core of this assignment is the Machine Learning technique(s) you will apply to your
game and its learning problem. The most practical approach would be to conduct
Reinforcement Learning via ML-Agents as demonstrated during class in week 10, and use
the considerations given in weeks 11 and 12 about State Representation and Reward
Function Design. You may use other learning packages and/or use AI techniques not
covered in class, e.g., Genetic Algorithm, but you must seek approval from the teaching
staff if you plan to take this route.
How you integrate the ML technique into your game is entirely up to you. As in the
previous assignments, you are encouraged to be creative. Ambitious projects will be
marked more leniently, provided your plan is realistic.
When designing (or updating) your game, you should think about how it will
accommodate your ML technique. While a more complex task justifies a more complex
solution, you may wish to simplify the problem initially, e.g., by disabling some
components of the game. For example, if you intend to use reinforcement learning, you
may wish to remove obstacles or enemies at first to see if your agent can learn to solve
simple tasks. Once you get the agent performing well on simple tasks, you can gradually
reintroduce more complex game elements. Throughout this process, you should keep
notes on what you tried, what worked and what did not, and any theories on why this
was so, so that you can discuss this in the final report.
You are permitted to make use of external code provided that it does not trivialise the
project and you properly reference all material (if unsure, talk to your lecturer in class).
Bear in mind that we will take the ambitiousness of your project into account during
grading, so if you strongly leverage existing tools, you will be expected to attempt a
challenging ML task

## ‚ùå What Not To Do

- ‚ùå Don't add any internet dependencies after installation
- ‚ùå Don't store sensitive data without user consent
- ‚ùå Don't ignore data backup/restore edge cases
- ‚ùå Don't use hardcoded file paths
- ‚ùå Don't forget to handle storage permissions

## ‚úÖ What To Do

- ‚úÖ Always ask questions if you are not sure
- ‚úÖ Always check the code to make sure syntax is correct  
- ‚úÖ Always read WORK_PROGRESS.md to understand current status
- ‚úÖ Always read TODO.md to understand what needs to be done
- ‚úÖ Always use DD/MM/YYYY format in UI (convert if needed)
- ‚úÖ Create/update WORK_PROGRESS.md to document your progress
- ‚úÖ Create/update TODO.md to track remaining tasks
- ‚úÖ Create COMMIT.md to explain what each commit does
- ‚úÖ Test data backup/restore functionality thoroughly
- ‚úÖ Ensure app works completely offline


By following these practices, we ensure the Giftly project stays scalable, maintainable, and completely self-contained üöÄ
